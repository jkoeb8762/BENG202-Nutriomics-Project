# BENG202: Bioinformatics Algorithms - Nutriomics Challenge

Optimization of Dietary Nutrient Supplementation for Rational Rebalancing of Human Gut Microbiome.

**Authors:** Zihan Wang, Ray Huang and Sang Yoon Byun

## Overview
This project focuses on the algorithmic optimization of dietary nutrient supplementation to rebalance the human gut microbiome. Through extensive data and computational analysis, we aim to provide a foundation for generating personalized prebiotics based on individual microbiome compositions.

## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x
2. Relevant Python libraries: numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib (others to be included based on your project requirements).

## Usage
1. **Data Processing:**
Run data_preprocessing.py to clean and prepare data.

2. **Algorithm Execution:**
Execute the algorithms provided in Nutriomics.ipynb

## Results
Our algorithms, including grid search, binary search, and random search, have significantly reduced the number of violations in deviant samples, successfully bringing a large portion of ASVs into normal states. More detailed results can be found in the pdf writeup.
